	<h1>Git main commands</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>git config --global user.name blabla
			<p>a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global level. *username*</p>
		</li>
		<li>git config --global user.email blabal@bla
			<p>a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global level. *email*</p>
		</li>
		<li>git init
			<p>This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. An initial branch without any commits will be created (see the --initial-branch option below for its name).</p>
		</li>
		<li>git status
			<p>displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.</p>
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add" target="blank">git add</a>
			<p>updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.</p>
		</li>
		<li>git commit
			<p>Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes.</p>
			<br><p>git commit -a -m "commit message" - закомитить изменения одной коммандой. (git add + git commit)</p>
		</li>
		<li>git log
			<p>Shows the commit logs. --olenile shows all commits with number and commit message</p>
		</li>
		<li>git checkout
			<p>Switch branches or restore working tree files</p>
		</li>
		<li>git branch<p>This command lists all the local branches in the current repository.</p>
		</li>
		<li>git push
			<p>This command sends the committed changes of master branch to your remote repository.</p>
		</li>
		<li>git pull
			<p>This command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.</p>
		</li>
		<li>git merge
			<p>This command merges the specified branch’s history into the current branch.</p>
		</li>
		<li>git clone
			<p>Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using git branch --remotes), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>.gitignore file
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul class="advanced">
		<li>git revert
			<p>The git revert command can be considered an 'undo' type command, however, it is not a traditional undo operation. Instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration.</p>
		</li>
		<li>git reset
			<p>git reset [file] - This command unstages the file, but it preserves the file contents.
				git reset [commit] - This command undoes all the commits after the specified commit and preserves the changes locally. Usage: git reset –hard [commit]  This command discards all history and goes back to the specified commit.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>git rebase</li>
		<li>git cherry-pick</li>
		<li>git stash</li>
